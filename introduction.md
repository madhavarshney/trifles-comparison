Hello reader! This project is a comparison between the play Trifles written by Susan Glaspell and the short story “A Jury of Her Peers” also written by her about a year later. The play is on the leftmost pane, the short story in the middle one, and our annotations and statistics in the rightmost panel.

These two works have identical plots, with the short story incorporating all of the dialogue from the play, and this allows us to take these two works and align them using fancy algorithms that we have written to truly compare the changes Glaspell has made. On this page we have also provided our own annotations and analysis of some of these changes. We hope that you find this tool as useful or at least interesting as we have and enjoy studying the two texts.

Note: Although the alignment below is not perfect, you will see that it is quite good overall. Getting it to this level was the main and most interesting challenge of this project and is the result of many iterations of different algorithms and ways of aligning the text.

Before you dive into the comparison, here are our general observations of the differences between the two texts:

1. The short story tends to have much richer descriptions of scenes, people, and their thoughts. This makes sense as this is one benefit of the short story genre--being able to elaborate about a moment to really emphasize its importance. This is something that cannot easily be done in a play or some stage directions, depending on the experience and interpretations of the actors.
2. In the short story, we see more emphasis on the women's role with more description about how they are feeling at different times. This is particularly apparent in the climax when the ladies examine the things they have picked out.
3. There are some things from the play that have been omitted in the short story and other things that have been added. For example, the repetition of the pleating of the apron was removed from the play in some places. Instead, the short story adds repetition of the two women staring intensely at each other or at different objects. 
4. Through this comparison of the same story in different genres, we noticed that even the most acclaimed writers revise their work--there are certain words, passages, and events that are revised in the short story that have their meanings subtly altered or written more explicitly.
