This project is a comparison between the play Trifles written by Susan Glaspell and the short story “A Jury of Her Peers” also written by her about a year later. The play is on the leftmost pane, the short story in the middle one, and our annotations and statistics in the rightmost panel.

These two works have identical plots, with the short story incorporating all of the dialogue from the play, and this allows us to take these two works and align them using fancy algorithms that we have written to truly compare the changes Glaspell has made. On this page we have also provided our own annotations and analysis of some of these changes. We hope that you find this tool as useful or at least interesting as we have and enjoy studying the two texts.

Note: Although the alignment below is not perfect, you will see that it is quite good overall. Getting it to this level was the main and most interesting challenge of this project and is the result of many iterations of different algorithms and ways of aligning the text.

Before you dive into the comparison, here are our general observations of the differences between the two texts:

1. The short story tends to have much richer descriptions of scenes, people, and their thoughts. This makes sense as this is one benefit of the short story genre—being able to elaborate about a moment to really emphasize its importance. This is something that cannot easily be done in a play or some stage directions, depending on the experience and interpretations of the actors.
2. In the short story, we see more emphasis on the women&#x27;s role with more description about how they are feeling at different times. This is particularly apparent in the climax when the ladies examine the things they have picked out.
3. There are some things from the play that have been omitted in the short story and other things that have been added. For example, the repetition of the pleating of the apron was removed from the short story in some places. Instead, the short story adds repetition of the two women staring intensely at each other or at different objects. 
4. Through this comparison of the same story in different genres, we noticed that even the most acclaimed writers revise their work—there are certain words, passages, and events that are revised and have their meanings subtly altered or written more explicitly in the short story.

At the rear the outer door opens and the Sheriff comes in followed by the County Attorney and Hale. The Sheriff and Hale are men in middle life, the County Attorney is a young man; all are much bundled up and go at once to the stove. They are followed by the two women—the Sheriff's wife first; she is a slight wiry woman, a thin nervous face. Mrs. Hale is larger and would ordinarily be called more comfortable looking, but she is disturbed now and looks fearfully about as she enters. The women have come in slowly, and stand close together near the door.</span><span class="number">0</span></div><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>By SUSAN GLASPELL</span><span class="number">0</span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>From Every Week</span><span class="number">1</span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>When Martha Hale opened the storm-door and got a cut of the north wind, she ran back for her big woolen scarf. As she hurriedly wound that round her head her eye made a scandalized sweep of her kitchen. It was no ordinary thing that called her away—it was probably farther from ordinary than anything that had ever happened in Dickson County. But what her eye took in was that her kitchen was in no shape for leaving: her bread all ready for mixing, half the flour sifted and half unsifted.</span><span class="number">2</span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>She hated to see things half done; but she had been at that when the team from town stopped to get Mr. Hale, and then the sheriff came running in to say his wife wished Mrs. Hale would come too—adding, with a grin, that he guessed she was getting scarey and wanted another woman along. So she had dropped everything right where it was.</span><span class="number">3</span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>"Martha!" now came her husband's impatient voice.

She had met Mrs. Peters the year before at the county fair, and the thing she remembered about her was that she didn't seem like a sheriff's wife. She was small and thin and didn't have a strong voice. Mrs. Gorman, sheriff's wife before Gorman went out and Peters came in, had a voice that somehow seemed to be backing up the law with every word. But if Mrs. Peters didn't look like a sheriff's wife, Peters made it up in looking like a sheriff. He was to a dot the kind of man who could get himself elected sheriff—a heavy man with a big voice, who was particularly genial with the law-abiding, as if to make it plain that he knew the difference between criminals and non-criminals. And right there it came into Mrs. Hale's mind, with a stab, that this man who was so pleasant and lively with all of them was going to the Wrights' now as a sheriff.</span><span class="number">6</span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>"The country's not very pleasant this time of year," Mrs. Peters at last ventured, as if she felt they ought to be talking as well as the men.</span><span class="number">7</span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>Mrs. Hale scarcely finished her reply, for they had gone up a little hill and could see the Wright place now, and seeing it did not make her feel like talking. It looked very lonesome this cold March morning. It had always been a lonesome-looking place. It was down in a hollow, and the poplar trees around it were lonesome-looking trees. The men were looking at it and talking about what had happened. The county attorney was bending to one side of the buggy, and kept looking steadily at the place as they drew up to it.</span><span class="number">8</span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>"I'm glad you came with me," Mrs. Peters said nervously, as the two women were about to follow the men in through the kitchen door.</span><span class="number">9</span></div><div class="diff-item annotations"></div></div><div class="diff-row"><div class="diff-item"><span></span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>Even after she had her foot on the door-step, her hand on the knob, Martha Hale had a moment of feeling she could not cross that threshold. And the reason it seemed she couldn't cross it now was simply because she hadn't crossed it before. Time and time again it had been in her mind, "I ought to go over and see Minnie Foster"—she still thought of her as Minnie Foster, though for twenty years she had been Mrs. Wright. And then there was always something to do and Minnie Foster would go from her mind.

I<span class="highlight"> spoke to Wright about it once before</span> and<span class="highlight"> he put me off, saying folks talked too much anyway, and all he asked was peace and quiet—I guess you know about how much he talked himself; but I thought maybe if I went to the house and talked about it before his wife,</span> though<span class="highlight"> I said to Harry that I didn't know as what his wife wanted made much difference to John—</span></span><span class="number">9</span></div><div class="diff-item"><span>Mrs. Hale, still leaning against the door, had that sinking feeling of the mother whose child is about to speak a piece. Lewis often wandered along and got things mixed up in a story. She hoped he would tell this straight and plain, and not say unnecessary things that would just make things harder for Minnie Foster. He didn't begin at once, and she noticed that he looked queer—as if standing in that kitchen and having to tell what he had seen there yesterday morning made him almost sick.

"Yes, Mr. Hale?" the county attorney reminded.

"<span class="highlight">Harry and I had started to town with a load of potatoes</span>," Mrs. Hale's husband began.

Harry was Mrs. Hale's oldest boy. He wasn't with them now, for the very good reason that those potatoes never got to town yesterday and he was taking them this morning, so he hadn't been home when the sheriff stopped to say he wanted Mr. Hale to come over to the Wright<span class="highlight"> place and </span>tell the county attorney his story there, where he could point it all out. With all Mrs. Hale's other emotions came the fear now that maybe Harry wasn't dressed warm enough—they hadn't any of them realized how that north wind did bite.

"We come along this road," Hale was going on, with a motion of his hand to the road over which they had just come, "and as we got in sight of the house I says to Harry, '<span class="highlight">I'm goin' to see if I can't get John Wright to </span>take a telephone.' You see," he explained to Henderson, "unless I can get somebody to <span class="highlight">go in with me </span>they won't come out this branch road except for a price I can't pay. I'd<span class="highlight"> spoke to Wright about it once before</span>; but<span class="highlight"> he put me off, saying folks talked too much anyway, and all he asked was peace and quiet—guess you know about how much he talked himself.

Mrs. Hale moved<span class="highlight"> toward it.

"She was </span>putting <span class="highlight">this in there</span>," she said to herself—slowly.

She thought of the flour in her kitchen at home—half sifted, half not sifted. She had been interrupted, and had left things half done. What had interrupted Minnie Foster? Why had that work been left half done? She made a move as if to finish it,—unfinished things always bothered her,—and then she glanced around and saw that Mrs. Peters was watching her—and she didn't want Mrs. Peters to get that feeling she had got of work begun and then—for some reason—not finished.

"<span class="highlight">It's a shame about her fruit</span>," she said, and walked toward the cupboard that the county attorney had opened, and got<span class="highlight"> on the chair</span>, murmuring: "I wonder if it's all gone."

It was a sorry enough looking sight, but "<span class="highlight">Here's one that's all right,</span>" she said at last. She held<span class="highlight"> it toward the </span>light.

This project is a comparison between the play Trifles written by Susan Glaspell and the short story “A Jury of Her Peers” also written by her about a year later. The play is on the leftmost pane, the short story in the middle one, and our annotations and statistics in the rightmost panel.\n\nThese two works have identical plots, with the short story incorporating all of the dialogue from the play, and this allows us to take these two works and align them using fancy algorithms that we have written to truly compare the changes Glaspell has made. On this page we have also provided our own annotations and analysis of some of these changes. We hope that you find this tool as useful or at least interesting as we have and enjoy studying the two texts.\n\nNote: Although the alignment below is not perfect, you will see that it is quite good overall. Getting it to this level was the main and most interesting challenge of this project and is the result of many iterations of different algorithms and ways of aligning the text.\n\nBefore you dive into the comparison, here are our general observations of the differences between the two texts:\n\n1. The short story tends to have much richer descriptions of scenes, people, and their thoughts. This makes sense as this is one benefit of the short story genre—being able to elaborate about a moment to really emphasize its importance. This is something that cannot easily be done in a play or some stage directions, depending on the experience and interpretations of the actors.\n2. In the short story, we see more emphasis on the women's role with more description about how they are feeling at different times. This is particularly apparent in the climax when the ladies examine the things they have picked out.\n3. There are some things from the play that have been omitted in the short story and other things that have been added. For example, the repetition of the pleating of the apron was removed from the short story in some places. Instead, the short story adds repetition of the two women staring intensely at each other or at different objects. \n4. Through this comparison of the same story in different genres, we noticed that even the most acclaimed writers revise their work—there are certain words, passages, and events that are revised and have their meanings subtly altered or written more explicitly in the short story.\n"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"V3sfUNrwKkhGv8rGsIAMc","assetPrefix":"/trifles-comparison","isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-eef578260fd80f8fff94.js"></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/chunks/webpack-189c53927ffd3caf09c3.js" async=""></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/chunks/framework-92300432a1172ef1338b.js" async=""></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/chunks/main-dd832e78bc6e17ab0329.js" async=""></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-8f06836959febc2a105f.js" async=""></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/chunks/ef6529d7-8fbf2209a46493fc5233.js" async=""></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/chunks/602-fb15f22b4f40cce686c2.js" async=""></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/chunks/pages/index-90eeb9b71a05cd6f1aca.js" async=""></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/V3sfUNrwKkhGv8rGsIAMc/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/trifles-comparison/_next/static/V3sfUNrwKkhGv8rGsIAMc/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
